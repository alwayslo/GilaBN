##Raster 03: Raster Calculations in R - Subtract One Raster from Another and Extract Pixel Values For Defined Locations##
Authors: Leah A. Wasser, Megan A. Jones, Zack Brym, Kristina Riemer, Jason Williams, Jeff Hollister, Mike Smorul

We often want to perform calculations on two or more rasters to create a new output raster. For example, if we are interested in mapping the heights of trees across an entire field site, we might want to calculate the difference between the Digital Surface Model (DSM, tops of trees) and the Digital Terrain Model (DTM, ground level). The resulting dataset is referred to as a Canopy Height Model (CHM) and represents the actual height of trees, buildings, etc. with the influence of ground elevation removed.

This code chunk compares two raster files
```{r}
GDALinfo("NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DTM/HARV_dtmCrop.tif")
GDALinfo("NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/DSM/HARV_dsmCrop.tif")
```
The raster files have the same CRS, the same resolution and defined minimum and maximum values.

We can perform raster calculations using (1) raster math or (2) overlay(). The second method is better for large rasters or complex equations.

*Raster Math & Canopy Height Models*

We can perform raster calculations by simply subtracting (or adding, multiplying, etc) two rasters. In the geospatial world, we call this “raster math”.

Below calculates the Canopy Height Model (CHM) using raster math and then plots the model. Looking at the map, areas of values close to zero have no canopy.
```{r}
CHM_HARV <- DSM_HARV - DTM_HARV 

plot(CHM_HARV,col=topo.colors(100),
     main="Canopy Height Model - Raster Math Subtract\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
     axes=F) 
```

The code chunk below looks at the histogram of CHM.
```{r}
hist(CHM_HARV,
  col="springgreen4",
  main="Histogram of Canopy Height Model\nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
  ylab="Number of Pixels",
  xlab="Tree Height (m) ")
```


```{r}
hist(CHM_HARV, breaks=6,
  col="springgreen3",
  main="Histogram of Canopy Height Model\nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
  ylab="Frequency",
  xlab="Tree Height (m) ")
```

```{r}
plot(CHM_HARV,col=terrain.colors(6),
     main="Canopy Height Model\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site",
     axes=F) 
```

*Efficient Raster Calculations: Overlay*
```{r}
CHM_ov_HARV<- overlay(DSM_HARV,
                      DTM_HARV,
                      fun=function(r1, r2){return(r1-r2)})

plot(CHM_ov_HARV,
  main="Canopy Height Model - Overlay Subtract\n NEON Harvard Forest Field Site")
```
*Export GeoTIFF*
Now that we’ve created a new raster, let’s export the data as a GeoTIFF using the writeRaster() function.

When we write this raster object to a GeoTIFF file we’ll name it chm_HARV.tiff. This name allows us to quickly remember both what the data contains (CHM data) and for where (HARVard Forest). The writeRaster() function by default writes the output file to your working directory unless you specify a full file path.
writeRaster Options

The function arguments used include:
format: specify that the format will be GTiff or GeoTiff.
overwrite: If TRUE, R will overwrite any existing file with the same name in the specified directory. USE THIS SETTING WITH CAUTION!
NAflag: set the geotiff tag for NoDataValue to -9999, the National Ecological Observatory Network’s (NEON) standard NoDataValue.
```{r}
writeRaster(CHM_ov_HARV, "chm_HARV.tiff",
            format="GTiff",  # specify output format - GeoTIFF
            overwrite=TRUE, # CAUTION: if this is true, it will overwrite an
                            # existing file
            NAflag=-9999) # set no data value to -9999
```
Data are often more interesting and powerful when we compare them across various locations. Let’s compare some data collected over Harvard Forest to data collected in Southern California. The NEON San Joaquin Experimental Range (SJER) field site located in Southern California has a very different ecosystem and climate than the NEON Harvard Forest Field Site in Massachusetts.

Import the SJER DSM and DTM raster files and create a Canopy Height Model. Then compare the two sites. Be sure to name your R objects and outputs carefully, as follows: objectType_SJER (e.g. DSM_SJER). This will help you keep track of data from different sites!

```{r}
CHM_ov_SJER<- overlay(DSM_SJER,
                      DTM_SJER,
                      fun=function(r1, r2){return(r1-r2)})

plot(CHM_ov_SJER,
  main="Canopy Height Model - Overlay Subtract\n NEON San Joaquin Experimental Range Field Site", axes=F)

writeRaster(CHM_ov_HARV, "chm_HARV.tiff", format="GTiff", overwrite=TRUE, NAflag=-9999)
```
Compare SJER and HARV CHM.

```{r}
hist(CHM_ov_HARV, breaks=50,
  col="springgreen4",
  main="Histogram of Canopy Height Model \n Harvard Forest",
  ylab="Frequency",
  xlab="Tree Height (m) ")

hist(CHM_ov_SJER, breaks=50,
  col="orange",
  main="Histogram of Canopy Height Model \n San Joaquin Experimental Range",
  ylab="Frequency",
  xlab="Tree Height (m) ")
```

##Raster 04: Work With Multi-Band Rasters - Image Data in R##
Authors: Leah A. Wasser, Megan A. Jones, Zack Brym, Kristina Riemer, Jason Williams, Jeff Hollister, Mike Smorul

This tutorial explores how to import and plot a multi-band raster in R. It also covers how to plot a three-band color image using the plotRGB() function in R.

To import multi band raster data we will use the stack() function.If our multi-band data are imagery that we wish to composite, we can use plotRGB() (instead of plot()) to plot a 3 band raster image.Multi band raster data can contain: (1)Time series: the same variable, over the same area, over time. Check out Raster Time Series Data in R to learn more about time series stacks.
(2)Multi or hyperspectral imagery: image rasters that have 4 or more (multi-spectral) or more than 10-15 (hyperspectral) bands. Check out the NEON Data Skills Imaging Spectroscopy HDF5 in R tutorial for more about working with hyperspectral data cubes.

Reading a raster in R defaults to reading the first band when using the raster function. Here we plot band 1 and review the band information (it tells us which band out of how many we are viewing).
```{r}
RGB_band1_HARV <- 
  raster("NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif")

grayscale_colors <- gray.colors(100,            # number of different color levels 
                                start = 0.0,    # how black (0) to go
                                end = 1.0,      # how white (1) to go
                                gamma = 2.2,    # correction between how a digital 
                                # camera sees the world and how human eyes see it
                                alpha = NULL)   #Null=colors are not transparent
plot(RGB_band1_HARV, 
     col=grayscale_colors, 
     axes=FALSE,
     main="RGB Imagery - Band 1-Red\nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site") 

RGB_band1_HARV
minValue(RGB_band1_HARV)
maxValue(RGB_band1_HARV)

```
We can use the raster() function to import specific bands in our raster object by specifying which band we want with band=N (N represents the band number we want to work with). To import the green band, we would use band=2.
```{r}
RGB_band2_HARV <- 
  raster("NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif", 
           band = 2)

plot(RGB_band2_HARV,
     col=grayscale_colors, 
     axes=FALSE,
     main="RGB Imagery - Band 2- Green\nNEON Harvard Forest Field Site")

RGB_band2_HARV
minValue(RGB_band2_HARV)
maxValue(RGB_band2_HARV)
```
We can import all bands using stack(). We can then plot and view the histogram and plot all three bands on top of eachother. 
```{r}
RGB_stack_HARV <- 
  stack("NEON-DS-Airborne-Remote-Sensing/HARV/RGB_Imagery/HARV_RGB_Ortho.tif")

RGB_stack_HARV
RGB_stack_HARV@layers
RGB_stack_HARV[[1]]
hist(RGB_stack_HARV,
     maxpixels=ncell(RGB_stack_HARV))
plot(RGB_stack_HARV, 
     col=grayscale_colors)
plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV, 
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3)
```
We can also do some image processing including image stretch "lin" or "hist".
```{r}
plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3, 
        scale=800,
        stretch = "lin")

plotRGB(RGB_stack_HARV,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3, 
        scale=800,
        stretch = "hist")
```
